/**
 * LC162 Find Peak Element
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its
 * neighbors.

 * Given a integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
 * If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
 *
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -inf
