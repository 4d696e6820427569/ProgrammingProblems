 * You are given an integer array nums. 2 players are playing a game with this
 * array: player 1 and player.
 *
 * Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both
 * players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes
 * one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e. nums[0] or 
 * nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player
 * adds the chose number to their score. The game ends when there are no more
 * elements in the array.
 *
 * Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are
 * equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true.
 * You may assume that both players are playing optimally.
