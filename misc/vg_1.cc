 * Maximum Occurring Character
 *
 * Given a string, return the character that appears the maximum number of
 * times in the string. The string will contain only ASCII characters, from
 * the ranges ('a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', '0'-'9'), and the case matters. If there is a
 * tie in the maximum number of times a character appears in the string, return
 * the character that appears first in the string.
 *
 * Example
 * text = abbbaacc
 *
 * Both 'a' and 'b' occur 3 times in text. Since 'a' occurs earlier, a is the
 * answer.
 *
