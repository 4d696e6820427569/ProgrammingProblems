 * People do not like reading text in which a word is used multiple times in a
 * short paragraph. Write a program which helps identify such a problem.
 *
 * Write a program which takes as input an array and finds the distance between
 * a closet pair of equal entries.
 *
 * For example, if 
 *
 * s = <"All", "work", "and", "no", "play", "makes", "for", "no", "work", "no",
 * "fun", "and", "no", "results">
 *
 * then the second and third occurences of "no" is the closest pair.

 * Iterate through the words in the paragraph, keeping track of the min_dist.

 * Time complexity: O(n) provided that there are n words in the paragraph.
 * Space complexity: O(d) where d is the number of distinct entry in the array.
