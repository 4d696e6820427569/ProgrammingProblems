 * 5.2 Swap bits
 * There are number of ways in which bit manipulations can be accelerated. For
 * example, as described, the expression x & (x-1) clears the lowest set bit in
 * x, and x & ~(x-1) extracts the lowest set bit of x.
 *
 * A 64-bit integer can be viewed as an array of 64 bits, with the bit at index
 * 0 correspnding to the LSB and the bit at index 63 corresponding to the MSB.
 * Implement code that takes as input a 64-bit integer and swaps the bits at
 * indices i and j.
 *
 * Hint: When's the swap necessary?

 * Extract the ith bit and jth bits using 2 masks.

 * (x >> i) & 0x1;
 * (x >> j) & 0x1;
 *
 * And apply the bits to the correct positions. The operation to use depends on
