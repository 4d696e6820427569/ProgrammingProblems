 *
 * 5.4 Find a closest integer with the same weight.
 * 
 * Define the weight of a nonnegative integer x to be the number of bits that
 * are set to 1 in its binary representation. For example, since 92 in base 2
 * is 1011100, the weight of 92 is 4.
 *
 * Write a program which takes as input a nonnegative integer x and returns a
 * number y which is not equal to x, but has the same weight as x and their
 * difference, |y - x| is as small as possible. You can assume x is not 0, or
 * all 1s. For example, if x = 6, return 5.
 *
 * Hint: Start with the least significant bit.

/**
 * BF solution: Find out the weight of the number x. We can do so by repeatedly
 * extract the last 1s and simply count. Let that weight be w.
 *
 * After that, we try to generate all number such that it has weight w and find
 * the number y such that |y - x| is smallest.
 *
 * This will take O( C(w, n) ). 
 *
 * Complicated to code the complete solution. We need a different approach.
