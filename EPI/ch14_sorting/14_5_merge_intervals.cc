 * 14.5 Merge intervals.
 *
 * Suppose the time during the day that a person is busy is stored as a set of
 * disjoint time intervals. If an event is added to the person's calendar, the
 * set of busy times may need to be updated.
 *
 * In the abstract, we want a way to add an interval to a set of disjoint
 * intervals and represent the new set as a set of disjoint intervals. For
 * example, if the initial set of intervals is [-4, -1], [0, 2], [3, 6], 
 * [7, 9], [11, 12], [14, 17], and the added interval is [1, 8], the result
 * is [-4, 1], [0, 9], [11, 12], [14, 17].
 *
 * Write a program which takes as input an array of disjoint closed intervals
 * with integer endpoints, sorted by increasing order of left endpoint, and an
 * interval to be added, and returns the union of the interval in the array and
 * the added interval. Your result should be expressed as union of disjoint
 * intervals sorted by left endpoint.
 *
 * Hint: What's the union of 2 closed intervals?
