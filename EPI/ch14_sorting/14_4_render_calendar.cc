 * 14.4 Render a calendar
 *
 * Consider the problem of designing an online calendaring applicatinon. One
 * component of the design is to render the calender, i.e., display it
 * visually.
 * Suppose each day consists of a number of events, where an event is specified
 * as a start time and a finish time. Individual events for a day are to be
 * rendered as nonoverlapping rectangular regions whose sides are parallel to
 * the X- and Y-axes.. Let the X-axis correspond to time. If an event starts at
 * time b and ends at time e, the upper and lower sides of its corresponding
 * rectangle must be at b and e, respectively.
 *
 * Suppose the Y-coordinates for each day's events must lie between 0 and L
 * ( a specified const ), and each event's rectangle must have the same
 * "height" (distance between sides parallel to the X-axis). Your task is to
 * compute the maximum height an event rectangle can have. In essence, this is
 * equivalent to the following problem
 *
 * Write a program that takes a set of events, and determines the maximum
 * number of events that take place concurrently.
 *
 * Hint: Focus on endpoints.
