/**
 * EPI Chapter 11 Heaps
 *
 * 11.1 Merge sorted files
 *
 * This problem is motivated by the following scenario. You are given 500
 * files, each containing stock trade information for an S&P 500 company.
 * Each trade is encoded by a line in the following format:
 * 1232111, AAPL, 30, 456.12
 *
 * The first number is the time of the trade expressed as the number of
 * milliseconds since the start of the day's trading. Lines within each file
 * are sorted in increasing order of time. The remaining values are the stock
 * symbol, number of shares, and price. You are to create a single file
 * containing all the trades from the 500 files, sorted in order of increasing
 * trade times. The individual files are of the order 5-100 MBs; the combines
 * file will be of the order of five gigabytes. In the abstract, we're trying
 * to solve the following problem.
 *
 * Write a program that takes as input a set of sorted sequences and computes
 * the union of these sequences as a sorted sequence. For example,
 * if the input is <3, 5, 7>, <0, 6>, <0, 6, 28>, then the output is
 * <0, 0, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 28>
 *
 * Hint: which part of each sequence is significant as the algorithm executes?
