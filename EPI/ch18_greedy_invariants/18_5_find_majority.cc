/**
 * EPI Chapter 18 - Greedy algorithm
 *
 * Several applications require identification of elements in a sequence which
 * occur more than a specified fraction of the total number of elements in the
 * sequence. For example, we may want to identify the users using excessive
 * network bandwidth or IP addresses originating the most HTTP requests. Here
 * we consider a simplified version of this problem.
 *
 * You are reading a sequence of strings. You know a priori that more than half
 * the strings are repetitions of a single string (the "majority element") but
 * the positions where the majority element occurs are unknown. Write a program
 * that makes a single pass over the sequence and identifies the majority
 * element. For example, if the input is {b, a, c, a, a, b, a, a, c, a}, then a
 * is the majority element (it appears in 6 out of the 10 places).
 *
 * Hint: Take advantage of the existence of a majority element to perform
 * elimination.
