/**
 * EPI Chapter 18 - Greedy algorithms
 *
 * In the gasup problem, a number of cities are arranged on a circular road.
 * You need to visit all the cities and come back to the starting city. A
 * certain amount of gas is available at each city. The amount of gas summed
 * up over all cities is equal to the amount of gas required to go around the
 * road once. Your gas tank has unlimited capacity. Call a city ample if you
 * can begin at that city with an empty tank, refill at it, then travel through
 * all the remaining cities, refilling at each and return to the ample city,
 * without running out of gas at any point.
 *
 * Given an instance of the gasup problem, how would you efficiently compute an
 * ample city? You can assume that there exists an ample city.
 *
 * Hint:
