 * 12.1 Search a sorted array for first occurence of k.
 *
 * Binary search commonly asks for the index of any element
 * of a sorted array that is equal to a specified element. The following
 * problem has a slight twist on this.
 *
 * Write a method that takes a sorted array and a key and returns the index
 * of the first occurence of that key in the array. For example, when applied
 * to the array, your algorithm should return 3 if the given key is 108;
 * if it is 285, your algorithm should return 6.
