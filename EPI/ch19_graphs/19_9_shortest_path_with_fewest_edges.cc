/**
 * EPI Chapter 19 Graphs
 *
 * 19.9 Compute a shortest path with fewest edges.
 *
 * In the usual formulatino of the shortest path problem, the number of edges
 * in the path is not a consideration. For example, considering the shortest
 * path problem from a to h on Page 345, the sum of the edge costs on the path
 * <a, c, e, d, h> is 22, which is the same as for path 
 * <a, b, k, i, j, f, g, h>. Both are shortest paths, but the latter has 3 more
 * edges.
 *
 * Heuristically, if we did want to avoid paths with a large number of edges, we
 * can add the small amount to the cost of each edge. However, depending on the
 * structure of the graph and the edge costs, this may not result in the 
 * shortest path.
 *
 * Design an algorithm which takes as input a graph G = (V, E), directed or
 * undirected, a nonnegative cost function on E, and vertices s and t; your
 * algorithm should output a path with the fewest edges amongst all shortest
 * paths from s to t.
 *
 * Hint: Change the edge cost and cast it as an instance of the standard
 * shortest path problem.
