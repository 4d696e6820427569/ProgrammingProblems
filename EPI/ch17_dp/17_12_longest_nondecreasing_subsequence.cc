/**
 * EPI Chapter 17 DP
 *
 * The problem of finding the longest nondecreasing subsequence in a sequence
 * of integers has implications to many disciplines, including string matching
 * and analyzing card games. As a concrete instance, the length of a longest
 * nondecreasing subsequence for the array
 *
 * {0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9}
 *
 * is 4. There are multiple longest nondecreasing subsequences, e.g.,
 * {0, 4, 10, 14} and {0, 2, 6, 9}. Note that elements of non-decreasing
 * subsequence are not required to immediately follow each other in the
 * original sequence.
 *
 * Write a program that takes as input an array of numbers and returns the
 * length of a longest nondecreasing subsequence in the array.
 *
 * Hint: Express the longest nondecreasing subsequence ending at an entry in
 * terms of the longest nondecreasing subsequence appearing in the subarray
 * consisting of preceding elements.
