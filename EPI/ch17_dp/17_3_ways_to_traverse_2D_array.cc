 * 17.3 Count the number of way to traverse a 2D array.
 *
 * In this problem you are to count the number of ways of starting at the
 * top-left corner of a 2D array and getting to the bottom-right corner.
 * ALl moves must either go right or down.
 *
 * Write a program that counts how many ways you can go from the top-left
 * to the bottom-right in a 2D array.
 *
 * Hint: If i > 0 and j > 0, you can get to (i, j) from (i - 1, j) or
 * (j - 1, i)
