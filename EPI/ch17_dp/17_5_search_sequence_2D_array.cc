 *
 * 17.5 Search for a sequence in a 2D array.
 *
 * Suppose you are given a 2D array of integers (the "grid") and a 1D array of
 * integers (the "pattern"). We say the pattern occurs in the grid if it is
 * possible to start from some entry in the grid and traverse adjacent entries
 * in the order specified by the pattern till all entries in the pattern have
 * been visited. The entries adjacent to an entry are the ones directly above,
 * below, to the left, and to the right, assuming they exist. For example, the
 * entries adjacent to (3, 4) are (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), and (5, 4). It is
 * acceptable to visit an entry in the grid more than once.
 *
 * As an example, if the grid is
 *
 * {
 *  {1, 2, 3},
 *  {3, 4, 5},
 *  {5, 6, 7}
 * }
 *
 * and the pattern is {1, 3, 4, 6}, then the pattern occurs in the grid -
 * consider the entries {{0,0}, {1,0}, {1,1}, {2,1}}. However, {1, 2, 3, 4}
 * does not occur in the grid.
 *
 * Write a program that takes as arguments a 2D array and a 1D array, and
 * checks whether the 1D array occurs in the 2D array.
